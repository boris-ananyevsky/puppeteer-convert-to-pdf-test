## Usage

``` npm i ```

``` node convert.js ```

The result of this is a "result.pdf" that will be created from "test.html" (found in the root directory).

You can change output directory and resulting file name by passing the path parameter

``` node convert.js "C:/Users/Username/Documents/result.pdf" ```
